# ERSA

The Exploratory Regression Shiny App (ERSA) package consists of a collection of functions for displaying the
results of a regression calculation, which are then packaged together as a shiny app function.


## Installation

You can install ERSA from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cbhurley/ERSA")
library(ERSA)
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

To use ERSA first do
```{r}
library(ERSA)
```
Then construct a regression model of your choice.
```{r eval=F}
f <- lm(Fertility ~ . , data = swiss)
exploreReg(f,swiss)
```
This opens up a browser through which you can explore the regression model.

Here is a screen shot of the result:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('vignettes/swiss.png')
```

Check out the vignette for more information and details.

## Shinyapps.io
To play around with ERSA on another dataset, check out the Shiny app on
[check out the Shiny app online](https://mustat.shinyapps.io/ERSAv1/).
 It uses the hprice1 dataset from the R package wooldridge.
